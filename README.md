A DPDK-based([dpdk-17.0.52](http://fast.dpdk.org/rel/dpdk-17.05.2.tar.xz)) IO interface, which named NAP,  for SF1500 platform
![](https://github.com/asterfusion/SF1500-OSAutoInstaller/blob/master/Docs/SF1500_front.jpg)

# What's the purpose of this interface ?
Help you to increase your development acceleration, reduce unnecessary barriers of your productions.

# How to run this example on SF1500 ?

1. Prepare runtime enviroment

  - Login to SF1500 download dpdk-17.05.2 from dpdk.org and abstract the archive to anywhere you want on SF1500.

  - Run following commands to support NAP compiling.

	root@OCTEONTX: export RTE_SDK=/home/dpdk-stable-17.05.2
	root@OCTEONTX: export RTE_TARGET=arm64-thunderx-linuxapp-gcc

  **Note** You can append this export things to /etc/bash.bashrc, and then source /etc/bash.bashrc.

  - Clone project from github

	root@OCTEONTX: git clone https://github.com/asterfusion/SF1500-NAP.git
  
2. Switch to top of this project and compiling
	
	root@OCTEONTX: cd SF1500-NAP
	root@OCTEONTX: source Compile.sh
	root@OCTEONTX: <wait for compile finished>
	root@OCTEONTX: make install
	root@OCTEONTX: tar -xvf napd-v2.5.0.$gitSHA.tar.gz
	root@OCTEONTX: cd napd
	root@OCTEONTX: ./install_nap.sh

3. Run nap
